# Visual Programming for toio&trade; (beta version)

This aims at serving a visual programming environment for toio&trade;
[here](https://toio.github.io/toio-visual-programming/beta/)
to control a cubic robot, called "Core Cube", by building programming blocks
such as moving forward, getting the current position, turning on its light
and so on.

You can find more information [here](https://toio.io/programming/visual-programming.html).

## Requirements

## Releases at GitHub pages

There are two releases at this GitHub pages.

* [beta release](https://toio.github.io/toio-visual-programming/beta/)
* [dev release](https://toio.github.io/toio-visual-programming/dev/)

Beta release is focused on stability to avoid breaking compatibility or
encountering regression,
since we expect that this visual programming environment would be used
by persons who are not expert at technology.
So this release is not agressively updated except critical bug fixes.

On the other hand, dev release is focused on new features, new languages
and bug fixes for hearing feedbacks from users by agressively merging PR.
